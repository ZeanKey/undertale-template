# UNDERTALE Template
## Intro
UNDERTALE Template is a GameMaker 2024 based UNDERTALE fangame template.<br/>

<i>
Note that the project is broken and no longer be supported, developing your game on this template is not suggested from beginners.
However, some unique implements like 360 degree blue soul, 3D battle board, 2D battle board with 3 axis spining, addition / substraction board are included in this project, so there's probably something that would be helpful for 'fancy' fangames.
If so, you're welcomed to use any code in this project. </i>
